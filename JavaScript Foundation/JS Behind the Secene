Deno,Bun, Node Js are JavaScript Environment
Q) How JavaScript Executes The Code?
A)       
            Before The Code Run-Time
   Step1: Code File --------------------> Syntax Tree(Tokenization)
                        Parsing
              
   Step2:   JIT(Just In Time) Compiler

   Step3:   Byte Code ------------------------------------------> Machine Code
