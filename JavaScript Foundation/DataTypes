PRINT THE DATA
  -->  console.log("Hi JavaScript");
  -->  process.stdout.write("Hello Js"); //print in same line where as console everytime we write console prints in new line
 CONSOLE IS USED FOR VARIOUS
   --> console.table({city:"Hyderabad'}); //views in table format
   --> console.warn({city:"None"}); // gives as warn in color

---DATATYPE
1. STRING -> is written in "". Eg: let name="Sravani";
2. NUMBER -> let age = 22;
3. BOOLEAN -> checks condition true or false i.e paymentDone = true;
4. BIGINT

5. UNDEFINED-> declared a variable but no value assigned to that variable.
6. NULL -> where we assign NULL value to a variable.Eg: cost = null; Itstype is "object"

7. OBJECT-> person = {name:"Sravani", age: 22}. Object is a non-primitive data type where multiple values assigned to a single variable.
8. SYMBOL

Check the data type of a variable. We use of "typeof(variableName)".
---VARIABLES
var score = 102;//old way i.e global scope
let score = 122; // modest way i.e local scope
const num = 22;// constant - it can't be changed once we declare. It must be assigned value while declaring the constandt only.

We prefer to declare variables in camelCase .Eg: userMobilePhone 
Variable Names cannot start with numbers.
