Q1)Write a `for` loop that loops through the array ["green tea", "masala tea","tea", "ginger tea"] and stops the loop when it finds "tea".
Store all teas before "tea" in a selectedTea array.
A) let arr = ["green tea", "masala tea","tea", "ginger tea"];
   let selectedTeas = [];
   for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
       if(arr[i]==="tea")
       break;
       selectedTeas.push(arr[i]);
   }
   console.log(selectedTeas);

Q2)Write a `for` loop that loops through the array `["London","NewYork","Paris","Berlin"] and skips "paris".Store the other cities in visitedCities array.
A)let cities = ["London","NewYork","Paris","Berlin"];
  let visitedCities = [];
  for(let i=0;i<cities.length;i++){
         if(cities[i]==="Paris")
         continue;
         visitedCities.push(cities[i]);
  }

Q3)Use a `for-of` loop to iterate through the array `[1,2,3,4,5]` and the stop the number when 4 is found. Store the numbers before 4 in an array named smallNum.
A)  for-of loop: is same works as for loop but here the syntax is automatically written initialization and ending just we need yo focus on logic
   let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
   let smallNum = [];
   for(const num of numbers){
      if(num]===4) break;
      smallNum.push(num);
   }

Q4)Use a `for-of` loop to iterate through the array `["green tea", "masala tea","herbal tea", "ginger tea"]` skip herbal tea. And store the other teas as preferredTeas.
A) let teas = ["green tea", "masala tea","herbal tea", "ginger tea"];
   preferredTeas = [];
   for(const tea of teas){
       if(tea === "herbal tea") continue;
       preferredTeas.push(tea);
   }

----------------IMPORTANT------------
Q5)Use a `for-in` loop to loop through an object containing city population. 
Stop the loop when the population is "Berlin" is found and store all previous cities population in new object named 'cityPopulation'.
A) let citiesPopulation = {
   "London":9600000,
   "NewYork":4700000,
   "Paris":500000,
   "Berlin":7000000,
  }
  let cityPopulation = {};
  //console.log(Object.keys(citiesPopulation));
  /*for(const key in object){
     if(Object.prototype.hasOwnPropert.call(object,key)){
        const element = object[key];
     }
  }*/
  for(const city in citiesPopulation){
       key = value
       if(city === "Berlin") break;
       cityPopulation[city] = citiesPopulation[city]; 
    }
console.log(cityPopulation);
