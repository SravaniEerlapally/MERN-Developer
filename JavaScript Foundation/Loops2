Q1)Write a `for` loop that loops through the array ["green tea", "masala tea","tea", "ginger tea"] and stops the loop when it finds "tea".
Store all teas before "tea" in a selectedTea array.
A) let arr = ["green tea", "masala tea","tea", "ginger tea"];
   let selectedTeas = [];
   for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
       if(arr[i]==="tea")
       break;
       selectedTeas.push(arr[i]);
   }
   console.log(selectedTeas);

Q2)Write a `for` loop that loops through the array `["London","NewYork","Paris","Berlin"] and skips "paris".Store the other cities in visitedCities array.
A)let cities = ["London","NewYork","Paris","Berlin"];
  let visitedCities = [];
  for(let i=0;i<cities.length;i++){
         if(cities[i]==="Paris")
         continue;
         visitedCities.push(cities[i]);
  }

Q3)Use a `for-of` loop to iterate through the array `[1,2,3,4,5]` and the stop the number when 4 is found. Store the numbers before 4 in an array named smallNum.
A)  for-of loop: is same works as for loop but here the syntax is automatically written initialization and ending just we need yo focus on logic
   let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
   let smallNum = [];
   for(const num of numbers){
      if(num]===4) break;
      smallNum.push(num);
   }

Q4)Use a `for-of` loop to iterate through the array `["green tea", "masala tea","herbal tea", "ginger tea"]` skip herbal tea. And store the other teas as preferredTeas.
A) let teas = ["green tea", "masala tea","herbal tea", "ginger tea"];
   preferredTeas = [];
   for(const tea of teas){
       if(tea === "herbal tea") continue;
       preferredTeas.push(tea);
   }

----------------IMPORTANT------------
Q5)Use a `for-in` loop to loop through an object containing city population. 
Stop the loop when the population is "Berlin" is found and store all previous cities population in new object named 'cityPopulation'.
A) let citiesPopulation = {
   "London":9600000,
   "NewYork":4700000,
   "Paris":500000,
   "Berlin":7000000,
  }
  let cityPopulation = {};
  //console.log(Object.keys(citiesPopulation));
  /*for(const key in object){
     if(Object.prototype.hasOwnPropert.call(object,key)){
        const element = object[key];
     }
  }*/
  for(const city in citiesPopulation){
       key = value
       if(city === "Berlin") break;
       cityPopulation[city] = citiesPopulation[city]; 
    }
console.log(cityPopulation);

Q6)Use a `for-in` loop to loop through an object containing city population.
Skip any city with a population below 3 million and store the rest in a new object named `largeCities`
A) let worldCities = {
         "Sydney":5000000,
         "Tokyo":9000000,
         "Berlin":3500000,
         "Paris":2200000
   };
   let largeCities = [];
   for(const city in worldCities){
       if(worldCities[city]<3000000){
             continue;
       }
       largeCities[city] = worldCities[city];

   }

-------------ForEach----------------------
Q7)Write a `forEach` loop that iterates through the array `["green tea", "masala tea","chai", "ginger tea"]`.
Stop the loop when "chai" is found, and store all previous tea types in array availableTeas.
A) let teaCollection=["green tea", "masala tea","chai, "ginger tea"];
   let availableTeas = [];
   teaCollection.forEach(function(tea) {
       if(tea ==== "chai"){
         return;//here we can't use break or continue as we're inside the function
       }
       availableTeas.push(tea);

   });
   
Q8)Write a `forEach` loop that iterates through the array ["Berlin","Tokyo","Sydney","Paris"].
Skip "Sydney" and store the other cities in a new array named "travelledCities"
A) let cities = ["Berlin","Tokyo","Sydney","Paris"];
   let travelledCities = [];
   cities.forEach((city)=>{
       if(city ==="Sydney"){
            return
       }
       travelledCities.push(city);
   })

Q9)Write a `for` loop to iterate through the array [2,5,7,9]
Skip the value 7 and multiply the rest by 2. Store the results in a new array named doubleNum.
A) let arr = [2,5,7,9];
   let doubleNum = [];
   for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
        if(arr[i]===7) continue;
        doubleNum.push(arr[i]*2];
   }


Q10)Use `for-of` loop to iterate through the array ["chai","black tea","herbal tea","green tea","cardomon tea"].
And stop when the length of current tea name is greater than 10. Store the teas in shortTeas.
A) let teas = ["chai","black tea","herbal tea","green tea","cardomon tea"];
   let shortTeas = [];
   for(const tea of teas){
        if(tea.length>10) break;
        shortTeas.push(tea);
   }
