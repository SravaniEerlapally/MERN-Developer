const Person = {
  name: "Sravani";

  greet(){
     console.log(`Hi, Myself ${this.name}`)
  }
}

Person.greet();//Hi, Myself Sravani

const greetFunction = Person.greet
greetFunction()// Hi, Myself undefined
  Reason: As soon as we transfer from one memory to another or variable changes the context is lost.
  To avoid this we need to "bind"

BIND
const boundGreet = person.greet.bind({name:"Radhe"});
boundGreet();// Hi, Myself Radhe

//bind,call and apply
