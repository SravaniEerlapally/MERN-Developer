Q)Why react called as spa(single page appliation)?
A)React is a single page appliation.
  In index.html most of are written in head , in body only no script and 1 id=root is written.
    What React does?
     It takes web application, in every application we have DOM nodes of HTML.
     React basically does is remove nodes and inject nodes at that place such that we don't have full page reload.

Q)JSX ?
A)Javascript return in format of HTML i.e stored as JSX

app.jsx accepts only single component.In single component we can add multiple tags to work.
